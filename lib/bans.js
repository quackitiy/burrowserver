// that were used from it are not banned with it (a VPN's address is many

// the account page still opens there, where a player can ask about it or
// delete their account. this machine's own address cannot be banned, which
// is also the address of everyone when a proxy or a tunnel stands in front
// and the server has not been told (AJ_TRUSTED_PROXY).
