// the alphas were animals players could not be: in 2013 they were animal
// types of their own (2, 3, 9 to 12, since given to the eagle, deer, hyena,
// otter, polar bear and owl), and that artwork is gone. what is left of
// them is in the NPC table (defPack 1025): the clips the adventures put on
// the map, each a drawing that can stand, face left or right, talk, cast
// and so on, but not walk.
//
// the client has one way to draw a player as something from that table:
// the Phantomizer den item, which swaps a player's animal for NPC 2, a
// phantom, that then follows it about (DenXtCommManager.denPhantomResponse,
// "dph": [ok, sfsUserId, on]). the patched client takes the NPC's id from
// one more field of that message (XtReplyDemuxer, avatar.NPCView in
// swf-src/). so a disguise is a "dph" that follows a player's animal
// wherever the client is told of the animal.
//
// what does not work, by the nature of it: the clip glides, as it has no
// walk; the animal under it still does everything, unseen (sit, dance,
// clothes); and a client keeps the first disguise it drew for an animal
// until that animal is drawn afresh, so changing from one to another shows
// when the player next changes rooms.
