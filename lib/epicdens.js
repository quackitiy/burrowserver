// Epic Dens: the world map's list of dens worth a visit (client side:
// VolumeSelector, DenXtCommManager.requestDenHighest).
//
// the official list named players, and its "AJHQ" button led to a showcase
// den Animal Jam HQ had furnished, a new one every so often, held as party
// 36. those showcase dens are still on the CDN, 53 of them, each a whole
// room with its furniture in the file. here the list is the showcase dens:
// the client shows a name per row and asks to enter "den<that name>", which
// the server answers by putting the player in the room. the client draws
// twenty rows at most, so the list is a different twenty each day, and the
// AJHQ button goes to one more.
//
// the files do not say what the dens were called. each is named after the
// den type it was built in, going by its file name.
